# Life Expectancy Prective Modelling

This is a Life Expectancy Predictive Modelling Project using data from the World Health Organisation

Project Scope:

* Life expectancy is a statistical measure used to estimate and individuals lifespan. 
* On an individual level, life expectency is crucial in determining one's plans, support and care. 
* On a large group level, it holds paramount socio-economical implications.
* On a country level, it is used to derive insights, analytics and further studies to better understand the needs and risk factors of populations.

Project Goals:

* Provide an estimate prediction of life expectancies across countries on the globe.
* One model should use the least information necessary to mitigate some countires concerns about sharing their senstive data.
* A second, more elaborate model, that can be used if states decide to share more data
* Part of the task will be to use our judgemnet as ethical data practioners to determine which features should be used.
